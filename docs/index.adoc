== Introduction

Tomb is a `groovy` library to use various filesystems in a quick an easy way. Tomb provides you with a generic abstraction to manipulate files in a filesystem and several backends to use it against.

Right now, Tomb implements two backends, `LocalFilesystem` and `AmazonS3Filesystem`.

== FilesystemProvider

`FilesystemProvider` is the interface that all the backends implement. It has the following methods:
